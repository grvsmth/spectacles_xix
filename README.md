Twitter bot to tweet play records from a database

This bot was created by Angus B. Grieve-Smith in conjunction with the [Digital Parisian Stage](https://github.com/grvsmth/theatredeparis) project.  It finds a date two hundred years in the past (or takes a date as a command-line argument) and looks that date up in a database table, derived from Wicks (1953).  It then retrieves information about plays that premi√®red on that date and generates a message describing that play, and tweets that play using the Twitter API.
